# DVSlideViewController

by Dick Verbunt

## What is DVSlideViewController

DVSlideViewController is an view controller, witch allows you to slide view controllers in- and offscreen with a swipe of your finger.


## Getting started

DVSlideViewController includes a demo application, showing how to create and configure an DVSlideViewController.

Essentially, DVSlideViewContoller is a UIViewController subclass.

The files you'll need to copy into your own project are in the 'DVSlideViewController' group in the Xcode project.

- DVSlideViewController.h and .m
- grayBackground.png

You also need to include QuartzCore to your project.
The remaining files in the Xcode project are included for demonstration purposes only.
